# Axum Maud And HTMX

This repo is just a sandbox POC repo for playing around with Axum, Maud, HTMX,
and other tech that I'm interested in incorporating into my personal Web
Dev projects.

**TODO:**

- [ ] Incorporate HTMX
- [ ] Incorporate Web Components
- [ ] Incorporate [Custom Page Router](https://github.com/tomit4/spa_go)
- [ ] Hook up to a PostgreSQL DB
- [ ] Think of fun project where this could be used
- [ ] Consider incorporating SSE or WebSockets depending on project
- [ ] Consider incorporating Redis
